Author: Fabian Krüger, Fabian.Krueger83@gmail.com, comments welcome

Files in the folder are organized according to topics:
- denscomb.R (evaluating and combining continuous density forecasts)
- vis.R (plotting tools, require the packages ``ggplot2'' and ``reshape'' which are freely available on CRAN, http://cran.r-project.org/)
- (more to be added)

See the files themselves for detailed documentation of the functions
Files can be sourced for use within R, e.g. > source("denscomb.R")
